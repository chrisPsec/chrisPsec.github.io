## Collecting parts for my new engine


Here I am (currently that's near the Arctic Circle), nearly paralyzed by the impression my new professional pursuit has made upon me. Its scope is not monstrously huge, but its many small parts overwhelm me, and remind me of a broken brass [pocket watch](https://www.flickr.com/photos/perrylens/3835038045/) my father gave me years ago: layered, intricate, complex - almost too complex at first glance, but surely sense can be made of it, with time, research, and perseverance.

What am I wringing my hands about, then? Who am I? Why would I believe anyone would even read this? What new engine?

I'll start with the engine. I'm somewhat of a car nut - my current project is a [1984 Volvo 245 GLT](http://forums.turbobricks.com/showthread.php?t=312359).  Though I'm not as deeply entrenched as a mechanical engineer working for NASCAR, and not quite as knowledgeable as an [ASE](https://www.ase.com/Home.aspx) certified master technician, I am a nut nonetheless. I particularly delight in the inner (and outer) workings of engines - reciprocating motion translated to rotary motion, converted into thrust? Awesome.  What I'm getting at is that I liken my current brain-training to building up an engine, and once it's complete, I can then plunk it down into the vehicle of my choosing - eventually a career in information security.

That's what I'm wringing my hands about. I must remind myself that I'll get there, one task at a time, in spite of my current position as total newbie. With the completion of this entry, I think I can say I've learned Markdown (or at least utilized it successfully, if not to its full potential).  Next, I'll start digging more deeply into the [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor, which I'm currently using to write. A close friend of mine has offered to recommend some packages and guide me through their potential uses, which I may play with in my next entry. Also worth noting is my usage of GitHub to host the text for these entries (I'm totally new to git and GitHub), and to build the site where they're published, via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Neat stuff, markdown especially (I'm new to this, bear with me). Here's a table:

###### Tables in the Perry Household
|Room | Types of Tables |
|-----|------------|
|Dining room | Dining, Wash|
|Living room | Coffee, End|
|Family room | Entertainment, End|
|Bedroom | Nightstand|
|Girl's Room | Art|
|Boy's Room | Changing|

Here's how that looks in markdown, for posterity:

To answer the remaining two questions: I'll start with a short blurb about me that I wrote to create my first repository on GitHub, entitled `hello-world`.
>I'm Chris. I'm dipping my toes into the world of GitHub and infosec. At the moment, I do not have any meaningful programming knowledge. This is all a bit daunting for me! I've always nourished a strong interest in the messy, huge world of information technology. I've become increasingly interested in information security, threats to information security, and the many related topics that follow and intertwine. I'm a victim of too many interests and pursuits: cars (particularly the Volvo 240), bicycles, beer, hiking, reading, parenting, and general home handymanship, to name a few.

A little more detail: my wife and I have two kids, who amaze me daily, and are complete goobers at all times. First and foremost, I'm a dad. My hobbies come second, and are hugely important to me. Cycling is a lifetime love of mine - I ride a hardtail mountain bike on singletrack trails around my home town, and when I don't feel like loading up the truck with a bike, I'll hop on my road bike and tour the pleasantly rustic back roads to the east of my house, directly accessible. I find the road riding is second to none in allowing me deep, sometimes therapeutic reflection. Another of my loves is gardening, as a supplement to our grocery purchases in the late spring and summer. Additionally, I delight in tinkering and cobbling, whether it's repairing a turntable or building a model airplane.

Currently I'm an employee of a small contractor under NASA, working as a video technician. My main duty during mission time (sounding rocket launches, aircraft testing, payload prototyping and testing) is setup and operation of high-speed cameras, followed by moderate data reduction and delivery, as well as designing, building, and maintaining the basic gigabit network needed to run the cameras across the launch range. Previously I was a photographer, but shifted to more challenging duties with far more technical requirements. I also maintain a small farm of (Windows) video recording servers.

I'm not sure that anyone outside of family and friends will read this. That's ok. Mostly I'm writing to journal and to track my progress, and to try something new!

I'll write again soon. If you made it this far, thank you!

_Acknowledgements and thanks:_
Many, many thanks to my super cool wife, whose patience with me is unequaled. Many more thanks to my children, who encourage me to improve our lives in any way that I can, and to stay inquisitive. Cheers and a twirl of the mustache to my dear friend John, who much more carefully, and with infinitely more organized thought processes, embarked upon a similar journey from which I draw at least 74% of my inspiration. You can read what he's done over at [swannysec.net](https://swannysec.net). Finally, thanks to @forgottensec over at [GitHub.com/ForgottenSec](https://github.com/ForgottenSec/Transitioning_Into_InfoSec/blob/master/index.md) for the excellent collection of how-to blogs for infosec newbies who want to start a career.
